Kind of a childish thing I thought would be funny to mess with my friends who post
quizzes about themselves on social media.

This program inserts a swear instead of the quiz taker's real name and uses spaces in between the swear
to bypass BuddMeter.com's swear filter.

You can complete the victim's quiz once and note the correct answers, then fill out
the corresponding answer's number in the click_correct_answer function to get all 10's
on their quiz so all the swears show at the top of the results page.

You'll need selenium on your machine as well.

Enjoy!
